# cs-clojure-test
A computer science test to assess clojure skills. 
<h2> Hello Fenton!! Welcome to your clojure test!!!</h2>
<h3>1. Use Leiningen to create a new Application.</h3> 
<h3>2. The created application must solve the following problem:</h3>

  The task is to create an application that takes a single integer input. The
  application will download the raw data from an json file (playerlist.json)
  and print a list of all pairs of players whose height in inches adds up to the integer input to the application. If no matches are found, the application will print "No matches found"

  Sample output is as follows:
  ```
  > app 139

  - Brevin Knight         Nate Robinson
  - Nate Robinson         Mike Wilks
  ```

  The algorithm to find the pairs must be faster than O(n^2). All edge cases
  should be handled appropriately. Though not strictly required, demonstrating
  comfort in writing unit tests will make your submission stand out. This is
  _not_ a closed book test. You are encouraged to reach out with any questions
  that you come across.


<h3>3. As mentined Data model for this problem is a json file and it's available in this repo.</h3> 

<h3>4. Use this repo to solve and post your answer in a branch of your own. Name the branch with your name.</h3>
